# Road Safety Device Kavach

Challenge:    To reduce the accident on the roads in night because of blind spot by headlights and overtaking vehicles on single lane road.

Idea:         To create a device that will automate the headlight system in the vehicles and assist the user in overtaking vehicles.

Sensor Used:  LDR sensor, Arduino Uno R3, LIDAR sensor, TFT Display

How this works:   (suppose this device is fitted in all the vechicles)
                  While driving in the night, when any vehicle coming from opposite direction. Our device detects the light of that vehicle
                  and switch the light into low beam and when that car's device detect the light of our car it switches the high beam into
                  the low beam.
                  As both car crossed each other the device stopped detecting the light and again changes the low beam to high beam.
                  This device also helps the driver while overtaking the heavy vehicle on the single lane road. This device detect wheather
                  any vehicle is coming from opposite direction or not.
                  If it found any vehicle is coming from another direction then it assist the driver of the car that is behind the heavy vehicle
                  (Still facing issues in understanding the situtation?? Do watch this video)
